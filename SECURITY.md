# Security Guidelines for RevisePDF

This document outlines security best practices for the RevisePDF application.

## Handling Sensitive Information

### Environment Variables

All sensitive information should be stored in environment variables, never in code or documentation:

1. **Local Development**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`
   - Never commit `.env.local` to version control
   - Keep your local environment variables secure

2. **Production**:
   - Set environment variables directly on the hosting platform (Heroku)
   - Never commit production credentials to version control
   - Rotate secrets periodically

### API Keys and Secrets

1. **Never hardcode** API keys, tokens, or secrets in your code
2. **Never commit** API keys, tokens, or secrets to version control
3. **Use placeholders** in documentation and templates
4. **Rotate secrets** regularly, especially after team member changes

## Authentication Security

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Session Management**: Use secure, HTTP-only cookies
3. **Password Storage**: Always hash passwords (using bcrypt)
4. **OAuth**: Follow OAuth provider best practices
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Database Security

1. **Row-Level Security**: Use Supabase RLS policies to restrict data access
2. **Service Role**: Only use the service role key on the server, never in client code
3. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal permissions needed for each operation
4. **Data Validation**: Validate all data before storing in the database

## Code Security

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs to prevent XSS
3. **CSRF Protection**: Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
4. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Code Reviews**: Conduct security-focused code reviews

## Deployment Security

1. **Environment Separation**: Maintain separate development and production environments
2. **Configuration Management**: Use environment-specific configurations
3. **Secrets Management**: Use a secrets management solution for team environments
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to production environments

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities
3. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a plan for security incidents
4. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits

## Security Checklist Before Deployment

- [ ] All sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- [ ] No secrets or API keys are committed to version control
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Authentication system is properly configured
- [ ] Database security policies are in place
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Output encoding is implemented
- [ ] CSRF protection is in place
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are configured

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting the project maintainers directly. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.
